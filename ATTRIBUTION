Additionally, the free icon set by FatCow Web Hosting was used in various places: http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons

The Duality core library embeds several bitmap fonts which are based on the Open Source font "Cousine" by Steve Matteson. The font itself is not embedded but manually altered character / glyph renderings are, in binary form.
