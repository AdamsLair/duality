_This is a message for you as a contributor. **Do not add this to your Pull Request description**._

### Pull Request Checklist

- Have you read the [**wiki article** on contribution](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/wiki/How-to-Contribute)?
- Have you done your changes in a **PR-specific branch**? If not, create one and pull your changes into it before submitting. In case your PR gets rejected, your `master` branch won't be out of sync.
- Have you checked **spaces and tabs**? Use tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment.
- Does your **code style** match Duality code style?
- Have you **documented public API** you added or changed?
- Have you **tested thoroughly** for functionality, stability and usability?
- Do all of your changes and additions **comply with the [project license](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/blob/master/LICENSE)**?

### Pull Request Roadmap

1. **First-level assessment** of the Pull Request to see if it aligns with any open issues and contains a reasonable addition or change.
2. **Review of functionality** and usability.
3. Work on and discuss change requests from item 2. Ping the reviewers when done. Loop back to item 2 until resolved.
4. **Review of implementation** and code style.
5. Work on and discuss change requests from item 4. Ping the reviewers when done. Loop back to item 4 until resolved.
6. **Merge**

This is generally what to expect, but we will deviate from this process where it makes sense: Small PRs might turn out to be instant merges, and depending on the topic some review items might not apply.
