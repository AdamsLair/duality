The Duality project uses a modified and partly extended version of the excellent "Silk Icons" made by Mark James. You can find his website with the full icon set here: http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/

Additionally, the free icon set by FatCow Web Hosting was used in various places: http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons

The Duality core library embeds several bitmap fonts which are based on the Open Source font "Cousine" by Steve Matteson. The font itself is not embedded but manually altered character / glyph renderings are, in binary form.

The Duality sample project "DualStickSpaceShooter" uses bitmap fonts which are based on the Open Source font "Josefin Sans" by Santiago Orozco.

The Duality sample project "BasicMenu" uses bitmap fonts which are based on the Open Source font "Duru Sans" by Sorkin Type Co (www.sorkintype.com) under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1. This license is available with a FAQ at: http://scripts.sil.org/OFL

The Duality sample project "Flap-Or-Die" uses bitmap fonts which are based on the Open Source font "Duru Sans" by Sorkin Type Co (www.sorkintype.com) and "Condiment" by Sudtipos (www.sudtipos.com) under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1. This license is available with a FAQ at: http://scripts.sil.org/OFL. It also uses the background song "Attack of the 8-Bit Hyper Cranks" by Eric Matyas (http://soundimage.org/).
