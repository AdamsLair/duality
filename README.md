### Building From Source

If you want to build Duality yourself, you can do so using Visual Studio or MonoDevelop by simply opening `Duality.sln` and selecting "Build Solution". On non-Windows systems, you will be able to build core projects only and have to unload any editor projects first. When building Duality from the command line, make sure to call `nuget restore Duality.sln` first, so the required packages can be restored.

All framework build results will be located in the shared `Build/Output` folder. Sample project build results will be separate, and located in their respective `Content/Plugins` subdirectories. To launch any of the included sample projects after building Duality, select it as a startup project in your IDE. Otherwise, you can use either `DualityEditor` or `DualityLauncher` as a startup project.

### Contributing

We're actively looking for contributors. Are you experienced with Duality and want to join the development team? Look at our [contribution guide](https://adamslair.github.io/duality-docs/pages/v3/how-to-contribute.html).
