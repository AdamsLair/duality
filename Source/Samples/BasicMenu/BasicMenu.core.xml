        <member name="M:BasicMenu.MenuComponent.GetAreaOnScreen">
            <summary>
            This returns the area on screen that is currently occupied by the SpriteRenderer.
            For simplicity, this works only if it is set with the ScreenOverlay flag.
            
            A full 2.5D implementation (no ScreenOverlay) would require more complex calculations.

        <member name="T:BasicMenu.UpdateMenuController">
            <summary>
            This Component implements an OnUpdate-based MenuController.
            Pros: Easier to set up, requires only to implement OnUpdate.
            Cons: The controller logic is called on every frame, even when nothing is happening.

        <member name="P:BasicMenu.MenuController.StartingMenu">
            <summary>

        <member name="T:BasicMenu.EventMenuController">
            <summary>
            This Component implements an Event-based MenuController.
            Pros: Logic gets called only when an event is fired, allows better timing due to the presence of 
            OnInit and OnShutdown.
            Cons: Requires to clean up the event listeners once finished.
