### Building From Source

If you want to build Duality yourself, you can do so using Visual Studio or MonoDevelop by simply opening `Duality.sln` and selecting "Build Solution". If you're on a non-Windows system, you will only be able to build core projects and have to unload any editor projects first.

When building Duality from the command line, make sure to call `nuget restore Duality.sln` first, so the required packages can be restored.

### Contributing

We're actively looking for contributors. Are you experienced with Duality and want to join the development team? Look at our [contribution guide](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality/wiki/How-to-Contribute).
