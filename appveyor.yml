# The following lines trigger a complete NuGet Package and Binary Release build.
# They do not attempt to deploy them - it's just a build, made available through artifacts.
# The reason why it's inactive is that releases are in fact a relatively rare thing,
# while AppVeyor runs on each commit. It's probably for the best to not accumulate 6 - 11 MB
# of disk space in the AppVeyor VM on each commit, never to go away because of build history.
#
# In order to do a manual build on your local machine, use the "Package Binary NoDocs.bat" script,
# or, if you have SandCastle HelpFile Builder installed, use the "Package Binary.bat" script.
# You will find the build results in the below artifact paths.
